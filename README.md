# typesense-autocomplete-demo

This is a demo that shows you how to build an autocomplete search interface using Algolia's [autocomplete-js](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete) library and [Typesense](https://typesense.org).

**NOTE:** `autocomplete.js` is a standalone UI library and is unrelated to the `Autocomplete` widget in the Instantsearch.js UI library. [Read more](https://github.com/typesense/typesense-instantsearch-adapter/issues/88#issuecomment-1021597634).
